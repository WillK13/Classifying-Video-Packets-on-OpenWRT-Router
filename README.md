# Classifying-Video-Packets-on-OpenWRT-Router

Thousands of packet flows were tracked using YouTubeTM videos received straight from the router with limited bandwidths, creating a unique dataset to input. I wrote a k-means clustering algorithm, which is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to analyze each column in the dataset, then put those outputs into a weighted regression, a type of machine learning, using the Python library Tensorflow.
